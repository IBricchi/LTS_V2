## First Call (08/05/2020)

We used the first call to break down what tools we were going to use to organize ourselves "git-hub projects", and set up some basic tasks there to keep organized.

We shared some useful links with eachother, we made a basic overview of how the project was going to be broken down, and gave ourselves until monday to do some research on the subjects we need to cover. Namely how to do nodal analysis with matrixes, aswell as some basic thought into how to create a data structure for the circuits.
